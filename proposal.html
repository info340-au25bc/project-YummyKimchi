        <!--Replace <p> here with proposal.-->
        <p>Some have large wardrobes, some have small. In the end, clothes get all over the place. Some may be in the wash, some are maybe in the closet, and others may be in your drawers. The problem is, regardless of wardrobe size, you may want to keep track of a combination of clothing or just clothing in general. We are interested in making a wardrobe/outfit tracker that can help you keep track of your favorite jeans and shirt, while also keeping you updated on the latest weather updates to plan around.</p>
        <p>No apps really focus on the “you” part of outfit/wardrobe management. Some apps like this <a href="https://outfittracker.app/">Outfit Tracker App</a> do well in managing that part of outfits you’ve worn outside, but not in tracking your clothes in general. We want to make an app surrounding that. Ideally, we’d also have categories/tags a person can label a piece of clothing or outfit with for different occasions and weather events. It is that side of wardrobe management we are focusing on. A wardrobe app that lets you transform your mental descriptions/uses for clothing into a tracker.</p>
