                    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
                    <!--Replace <p> here with proposal.-->
                    <p>Some have large wardrobes, some have small. In the end, clothes get all over the place. Some may be in the wash, some may be in the closet, and others may be in your drawers. The problem is, regardless of wardrobe size, you may want to keep track of a combination of clothing or just clothing in general. We are interested in making a wardrobe/outfit tracker that can help you keep track of your favorite jeans and shirt, while also keeping you updated on the latest weather updates to plan around.</p>
                    <p>No apps really focus on the “you” part of outfit/wardrobe management. Some apps like this <a href="https://outfittracker.app/">Outfit Tracker App</a> do well in managing that part of outfits you’ve worn outside, but not in tracking your clothes in general. We want to make an app surrounding that. Ideally, we’d also have categories/tags a person can label a piece of clothing or outfit with for different occasions and weather events. It is that side of wardrobe management we are focusing on. A wardrobe app that lets you transform your mental descriptions/uses for clothing into a tracker.</p>

                    <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
                    <!--Replace <p> here with proposal. REMEMBER TO USE PROPER SEMANTICS (like lists for a list)-->
                    <!--The canvas page also said to use subsections if needed as well (another section, in this section)-->
                    <p> Our application aims to help our main target base, young adults who are looking to save money and make the most out of
                        the clothes that they already have by giving them smart outfit recommendations. Our main goal
                        is to help users in the long run save money and encourage mindful consumption which in turn
                        <a href="https://earth.org/fast-fashions-detrimental-effect-on-the-environment/"> helps promote sustainability</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p> Our app will work by having users upload photos of their clothes and given the option to add attributes
                        such as color, category, and season. The app's recommendation algorithm will then suggest a stylish and practical outfit
                        that is also appropriate for the weather utilizing a <a href="https://api.weather.gov/"> weather API</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p> Users will also be able to build and save outfits on their own by utilizing the app's drag and drop feature which
                        will help better visualize their outfit when put together in real life; removing the hassle of having to play dress-up in real life.
                    </p>
                    <p> Overall, we hope that our app will bring organization and help people discover new ways to style their clothes. We hope that people feel more satisfied
                        with the clothes that they already own  which will hopefully reduce unneccessary spending on new clothes which, negatively impacts the environment. In addition to promoting sustainability
                        and reduction in spending, we, in the end just hope to help users spark creativity, and to transform dressing up into something fun and less of a headache.
